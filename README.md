# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

## Learning Goals

- Understand what you will learn in this section

***

## Key Vocab

- **Data Structures**:  are a specialized means of organizing and storing data
 in computers
- **Algorithm**: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or
 other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

## Introduction

In this section, we'll return to a topic that will help you greatly as you
prepare for the job hunt and get ready for technical interviews: data
structures and algorithms! Understanding
**when to use different data structures and algorithms** as well as
**how to implement them** will equip you with more tools to solve common
algorithm problems more efficiently, and will also improve your skills at
writing Object Oriented code.

The objectives for this section are to:

- Evaluate the tradeoffs between choosing one data structure or algorithm over another
- Implement common data structures and algorithms
- Identify the Big O of common data structure methods
- Apply common data structures to algorithm problems

In the coming lessons, we'll cover these objectives by introducing several
common data structures and algorithms, showing how to implement them in Python,
 and giving you practice with problems that can be solved using these data
structures and algorithms so you can recognize common patterns to identify
when a particular data structures and algorithm is appropriate.

Let's dive in!
